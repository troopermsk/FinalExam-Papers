<h1>Journals and papers</h1>

The program simulates the management of journals and papers.
All classes are found in the <b>journals</b> package. The main class is <b>Journals</b>.
The <b>TestApp</b>  class in the <b>example</b> package contains examples and presents the main test cases but not all.
Exceptions are thrown using the <b>JException</b> class; only the specified checks must be carried out and not all possible ones.
If a method throws an exception there is no change in the data present in the main class.
Suggestion: every time you have implemented a method, run TestApp to check the result.

The method throws an exception if the author has not been registered. If the author has no papers the result is 0.0.
